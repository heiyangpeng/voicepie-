## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q1: The livestream audience cannot hear translation audio.

<span style="color:red;">A1: On Android devices, search for "Dolby" in the settings menu. Disable Dolby Audio or switch to the phone‚Äôs default sound settings. Some Android devices default to Dolby Audio, which may prevent translation audio from being heard in the livestream.</span>

Q2: My iPhone cannot find the Bluetooth transmitter (model: m1).

<span style="color:red;">A2: Ensure the iPhone previously connected to the transmitter has "forgotten" the Bluetooth connection for model m1. The transmitter must display continuous red and blue flashing lights after powering on to be discoverable. If the lights only flash briefly and then stop, the transmitter has reconnected to the previously paired iPhone.</span>
